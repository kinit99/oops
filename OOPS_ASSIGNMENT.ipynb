        "**ANSWER 01.** The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is a way of enforcing modularity and protecting the internal state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on simplifying complex systems by breaking them into more manageable parts, hiding unnecessary details, and exposing only the essential aspects. This allows the programmer to interact with objects at a higher level of complexity without needing to understand all the internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class. The new class, called a subclass or derived class, can add or override features of the parent class, promoting code reuse and logical hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, making the code more flexible and reusable. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding or method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: Often considered an important concept in OOP, composition is the principle where objects are made up of other objects. This promotes a \"has-a\" relationship, where complex objects are composed of smaller, simpler objects, leading to modular design and reuse of components."

Python resolves it using Method Resolution Order (MRO), which follows the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order in which methods are inherited.\n",
